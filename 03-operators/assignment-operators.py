"""In Python, assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. They are used to store data in variables for later use in your code. Python provides a variety of assignment operators that allow you to assign values in different ways. Here are some of the most commonly used assignment operators in Python:

Assignment Operator (=):

The basic assignment operator is "=".
It assigns the value on the right-hand side to the variable on the left-hand side.
Example: ""x = 10"" assigns the value 10 to the variable x.
Addition Assignment (+=):

This operator adds the value on the right-hand side to the current value of the variable on the left-hand side.
Example: x += 5 is equivalent to x = x + 5.
Subtraction Assignment (-=):

This operator subtracts the value on the right-hand side from the current value of the variable on the left-hand side.
Example: x -= 3 is equivalent to x = x - 3.
Multiplication Assignment (*=):

This operator multiplies the current value of the variable on the left-hand side by the value on the right-hand side.
Example: x *= 2 is equivalent to x = x * 2.
Division Assignment (/=):

This operator divides the current value of the variable on the left-hand side by the value on the right-hand side.
Example: x /= 4 is equivalent to x = x / 4.
Floor Division Assignment (//=):

This operator performs floor division (integer division) on the current value of the variable on the left-hand side by the value on the right-hand side.
Example: x //= 3 is equivalent to x = x // 3.
Modulus Assignment (%=):

This operator calculates the remainder when dividing the current value of the variable on the left-hand side by the value on the right-hand side.
Example: x %= 7 is equivalent to x = x % 7.
Exponentiation Assignment (**=):

This operator raises the current value of the variable on the left-hand side to the power of the value on the right-hand side.
Example: x **= 2 is equivalent to x = x ** 2.
Bitwise Operators Assignment (&=, |=):

These operators perform bitwise AND and OR operations between the current value of the variable on the left-hand side and the value on the right-hand side.
Example: x &= 3 is equivalent to x = x & 3.
These assignment operators are useful for updating variables efficiently and concisely within your Python code. They can help reduce the amount of redundant code when performing operations on variables."""
